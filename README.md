**Likert Scale Visualization**
- Creating and running a survey is only half the work - now you have to analyze the results! The Likert scale is one of the most common scales used in surveys across industries. This template conveniently converts Likert scale survey results into one easy-to-read visualization to summarize your survey results nicely.  
Your data must meet these requirements for this template:  
- The first column must contain the questions or statements of your survey. 
- The second to fifth columns represent the percentage of respondents that selected "Strongly agree", "Agree", "Neutral", "Disagree", "Strongly disagree", respectively, for each question. The order of the columns matters and percentage symbols shouldn't be included. Each row should add up to 100.
